    <h4 class="font-weight-bold">Ports</h4>
     A port is an endpoint of communication. Physical as well as wireless connections are terminated at ports of hardware devices.
     At the software level, within an operating system, a port is a logical construct that identifies a specific process
     or a type of network service. Ports are identified for each protocol and address combination by 16-bit unsigned numbers,
     commonly known as the port number. A system's ports are divided into 2 categories in regards to their port number:<br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Registered Ports:</b> (1-1024) ports assigned to protocols by IANA (eg. HTTP:80, HTTPS:443,...)</li>
      <li> <b>Ephemenal Ports:</b> (1024-65535)  randomly assigned to a connection</li>
    </ul>
