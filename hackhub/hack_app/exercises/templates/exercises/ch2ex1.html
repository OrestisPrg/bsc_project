      Nmap (Network Mapper) is a command line tool for network discovery and security auditing. It can be used by a hacker to collect valuable information for systems and networks especially during the process of footprinting.
      Using raw IP packets, amongst many others, Nmap is able to:
    <ul>
      <li> Determine the available hosts on a network. </li>
      <li> Obtain information about the services the hosts are offering such as their name and version. </li>
      <li> Retrieve information about the hosts' operating systems such as name and version. </li>
      <li> Discover and identify open & close ports on a network or a host. </li>
      <li> Send crafted packages to networks and hosts. </li>
      <li> Identify the type of packet filters and firewalls the hosts use. </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Due to its information retrieving and data collecting capabilities, Nmap is a powerful tool that can be used to initiate an attack to a system.
      Upon discovering a host's open ports, it can use them to obtain information about the host's OS and DNS lookups. This allow Nmap to determine and test if a host is vulnerable to exploitation.

    <h4> Usage </h4>

  <div class="row">
    <p>
      In the following section the field <code>[IP] </code> stands for a host's IP Address and <code>[hostname] </code> for a host's address as URL. You can view your machine's IP address using the <code> ifconfig </code> command.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="my-2">
        <b>Basic Scan: </b> <code class="command"> nmap [IP or hostname] </code>

      <hr class="divider">
      <li class="my-2">
        <b> Port type scan: </b> <code class="command"> nmap <b>[option]</b> [IP or hostname] </code><br />
        Options:
        <ul>
          <li> <b><code>-sS </code></b> scans using TCP SYN scan, to identify what ports are open without waiting for an acknowledgment from the TCP connection (default)</li>
          <li> <b><code>-sT </code></b> scans TCP ports.</li>
          <li> <b><code>-sU </code></b> scans UDP ports.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <hr class="divider">
      <li class="my-2">
        <b> Specific port scan: </b> <code class="command"> nmap <b>[option]</b> [IP or hostname] </code><br />
        Options:
        <ul>
          <li> <b><code>-p [port_number] </code></b> scans a single port (default).</li>
          <li> <b><code>-p [port_range] </code></b> scans a range of ports eg. 1-10.</li>
          <li> <b><code>-p- </code></b> scan all 65535 ports.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <hr class="divider">
      <li class="my-2">
        <b> Scan the most popular ports: </b> <code class="command"> nmap <b>--top-ports [num_of_ports]</b> [IP or hostname] </code>
      </li>
      <hr class="divider">
      <li>
        <b>Include OS and service detection: </b> <code> nmap -A [IP or hostname]</code><br />
        This is a very good way to obtain useful information which may help in detecting potential exploits for particular services. Including the <code> -T4 </code> option will make the execution faster.

      <p>
        Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) provides users with a broad collection of scripts automating a wide variety of networking tasks. Using the scripts, users can perform more sophisticated network discovery and OS detection. NSE also allows to perform vulnerability detection and exploitation.<br />
        <br />
        Apart from the Nmap's scripts and the ones provided from the community, users are able to create custom scripts. On Kali, scripts are located in /usr/share/nmap/scripts and can be identified by the <em>.nse </em> extension or simply by using the <code>locate *.nse </code> command.</p>
