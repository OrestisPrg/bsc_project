    <h4>Users</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p>
      A UNIX-like system's user can either be a regular user, an administrative user or a service account.
      <ul>
        <li>
          An administrative <b>root</b> account, commonly known as a superuser, is automatically created
          and has administrative privileges for all services, access to all commands and files on the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          Regular users have the necessary privileges to perform standard tasks on a Linux computer such as
          running word processors, databases, and Web browsers. They can store files
          in their own home directories. Since regular users do not normally have administrative privileges,
          they cannot accidentally delete critical operating system configuration files.
        </li>
        <li>
          Services such as Apache, Squid, mail, games, and printing have their own individual service accounts.
          These accounts exist to allow each of these services to interact with your computer.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

      <h3> The Command-Line Interface (CLI) </h3>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p>
      As opposed to the widely known and used Graphical User Interface (GUI), the CLI is a very useful and powerful
      tool for users that seek simplicity, efficiency and speed. Although this might sound odd if you are not
      not familiar with CLI, this exercise will introduce you to fundamental concepts and usages of a Linux system's
      terminal.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h4 class="display"> The Command Prompt </h4>
    <p>
      By default, in a new terminal window, the user is at their home directory and can see a command prompt
      consisting of the following components <code> [user]@[computer_name]:[current_path]$ </code> where:
      <ul>
        <li><code>[user]</code> is the username of the logged in user.</li>
        <li><code>[computer_name]</code> is the name of the computer user is logged in.</li>
        <li><code>[current_path]</code> is where the directory path the user currently is.</li>
        <li>The <code> $ </code> symbol indicates the user is a regular user that doesn't have root priviledges. A root user is denoted by a <code> # </code> symbol.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p class="font-italic"> <br />
      You must always perform tasks working as a regular user unless the directory or files you are working on
      require root priviledges. Working as root on regular directories/files will not only change their permissions to root, but
      prevents you from accidentally deleting or altering critical operating system files.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <h4> Terminal Commands</h4>
  </div>
  <p>
    The general structure of the terminal's commands constists of 3 components : <code>command [-option(s)] [argument(s)]</code> <br />
    The command name is typed first, followed by any optional options and arguments. <br />
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Options</b> can be either a single character preceeded by a hyphen (-) or a string proceeded by 2 hyphens (--).
         Most commands provide a help option (usually <code>-h</code> or <code> --help</code>) that lists and demonstrates the usage of the available options and arguments.
        <br /><i>Note: some options require their own arguments. Their usage can be also demonstrated with the help option.</i>
    </li>
      <li><b>Arguments</b> are usually used to specify the location of a file or directory by providing its path or any other associated information such as a file's or directory's name. </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <div class="row">
    <h4>Basic Commands</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b> <code> ls </code></b> lists the files and directories located in the current directory<br />
        Options:
        <ul>
          <li><code>-a </code> lists all entries including hidden entries (starting with a period) and the parent directory (..) </li>
          <li><code>-l </code> additionally displays the entries' permissions, links, owner, group, size, time and name.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
